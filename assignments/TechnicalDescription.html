            <p class="text-start">PyCharm is one of the most popular and industry leading Python integrated development environments (IDE). As you will learn in this guide, IDEs are inherently popular amongst novices and professionals alike because of the encapsulation (putting many tools and features into one place) that they provide. By the end of this guide we will know how to: </p>

            <h4 class="display-6 text-center">Installing PyCharm</h4>
            <p class="text-start">To install PyCharm we need to visit the PyCharm website and go to the <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/">downloads</a> section. The first download button we see is for Pycharm Professional which requires a license to be used. This version of PyCharm has more workplace features and is not free. We want to download the free community version of PyCharm, to download the community version simply scroll to the bottom of the webpage and find "Pycharm Community Edition".</p>

            <img class="img-fluid screenshot mx-auto d-block" src="../img/screenshots/download.PNG">

            <p class="mt-4 mb-4">Here we can download the free version of PyCharm. Notice the OS/Platform selection at the top of the page. Select your corresponding operating system.
               <b>Note:</b>  Silicon Mac users (M1/M2 chips) need to select the dropdown arrow on the right and select "Apple Silicon" installer if you do not do this you may experience performance issues.
            </p>


            <img class="img-fluid screenshot mx-auto d-block" src="../img/screenshots/download2.PNG">

            <p class="mt-4 mb-4">
                Once downloaded run the installer on your system and follow along with the installation wizard to guide you through the installation process.

            <h4 class="display-6 text-center">Set Up a New Project</h4>

            <p class="mt-4 mb-4">To begin a new project lets launch PyCharm, you will be greeted with the following screen.</p>

            <img class="img-fluid screenshot mx-auto d-block" src="../img/screenshots/newproject.PNG">

            <p class="mt-4 mb-4">To create a new project click the "New Project" button. A new screen will flyout and here we can configure our type of project. For our advanced users let's briefly step through what each setting does. If you are new to this you can generally just click the "Create" button as the default configuration will already work.</p>

            <img class="img-fluid screenshot mx-auto d-block" src="../img/screenshots/newproject2.PNG" alt="">

            <ul class="mt-4 mb-4 options-exp">
                <li><b>Location</b>: This is the location where your new project will be stored. The default folder is "C:\Users\User\PycharmProjects"</li>

                <li>
                    <b>"New environment using"</b> or <b>"Previously configured interpreter"</b>: Of these two options one can only be selected. The first option allows you to create a new virtual environment which is essentially a folder where we can download project dependencies and libraries. The other option allows you to select a previously configured virtual environment by providing the path to the folder.  
                </li>

                <li><b>Inherit global site-packages</b>: This option will install libraries and packages from your local interpreter to the virtual environment that you will create.</li>
                <li><b>Make available to all projects</b>: This option will make this virtual environment available to future projects, not just exclusively this one.</li>

                <li><b>Create a main.py welcome script</b>: This option creates a default simple program to run when the project is created.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="mt-4 mb-4">
                Lets shift our attention to the left side of the project creation. Here we can see a list of preconfigured projects for various frameworks. Clicking on one of these options will allow you to quickly create a project of that type and PyCharm will handle the installation of extra dependencies and packages. In this guide we will configure a simple pure python project, so lets click the "Create" button.

            <h4 class="display-6 text-center">Navigate the UI</h4>

            <p>Now that we've created our project let's learn how to navigate the IDE. Refer to the diagram below.</p>

            <img class="img-fluid screenshot mx-auto d-block" src="../img/screenshots/navigate1.png" alt="">

            <ul class="mt-4 mb-4 options-exp">
               <li>Project Tree - To the left you will see the project file tree which show all the folders and files in the project folder. <em>Double clicking</em> on a file here will open it in the text editor.</li>
               <li>IDE Settings Menu -
                <ul>
                    <li>File : Here we can find IDE related settings, for example in file we can find settings related to saving the code, renaming the code, closing the project, recent projects etc.</li>

                    <li>Edit : Here we can find text editing related settings such as redo, undo, copy, paste, cut etc. All these settings have shortcuts as well.</li>

                    <li>Navigate : Here we can find settings that can help us navigate our code, we can use Navigate to look for specific code and functions by searching.
                    </li>

                    <li>Code : Here we can find settings that help us while coding such as copying lines up or down, analyzing code, formatting code etc.</li>
                    <li>Refactor : Here we can find settings that allow us to refactor (change/improve) our code.</li>
                    <li>Run : This is self explanatory, here we can find settings related to running and executing code.</li>
                    <li>Tools : Here we can find built in IDE tools for creating files, configuring servers and interacting with other services etc.</li>
                    <li>VCS : Version control allows us to track changes in our code by linking a version control system such as github, and allows us to easily push changes to those code repositories online.</li>
                </ul>
               </li>
               <li>Opened Files - This is where we can see and swap through our currently open files. To close them click the x.</li>
               <li>Run Tools - Here we can run, stop, and debug our code.</li>
               <li>Text Editor - Here we can type and edit our code.</li>
               <li>Output and version control - This is where we can monitor code output with the terminal or pycharm console and also configure version control settings.</li>
            </ul>
